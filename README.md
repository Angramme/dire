# dire
a simple windows/linux cli for printing out the directory structure and sizes

## usage
Use the command `dire scan` to scan the current working directory. The directory contents will be outputed in a sorted order from the heaviest to lightest file size. 
You can then explore the generated tree structure to find the files and folders that take the most space on your computer.

## build
